Rebol.tmbundle
---------------------

A **TextMate Bundle** for the **Rebol** programming language.
    
Installation:
-------------

    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/
    git clone git://github.com/rgchris/rebol-tmbundle Rebol.tmbundle

It may be necessary to create the `Bundles` folder if no user bundles have been installed.

Notes:
----------

Commands currently assume Rebol is installed in `/usr/local/bin` as `rebol` (Rebol/Core 2.7.8) or `rebview` (Rebol/View 2.7.8) (pre-Catalina MacOS). Future upgrades to commands will use [Rebol 3 Core](https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol3) by Oldes.
